    This database catalogs cell phones made between the year 2000 and 2009 that bridged the gap between the flip phone/Nokia-style "brick" phone and the touchscreen smartphone. As tech capabilities expand and experimental designs are made, we can see how designs start to settle into similar shapes toward the late 2000s. My personal favorites from this list are the Nokia 7600 (sometimes nicknamed the Leaf) the Nokia Communicator series, and the Nokia 5510.
    <br>
    <br>
    I omitted any phones that were never officially released, like the Nokia 7700. Also, if I couldn't find any information about a phone except for its name and maybe its release year, I didn't put it in this database. Phones made by BlackBerry were also not included, because there's not much variation in individual designs.
    <br>
    <br>
    This database is not a complete list of every phone in the transitionary period! If I missed something that you'd like to see on the site, please send me an email at choverm@ufl.edu.
